To run any of the algorithms open and run train_"algorith" 

train_MOM
train_SSAB
train_RPROP
train_GA
train_PSO

The parameters for each algorithm can be adjusted in these scripts, different datasets can also be tested by changing the file name loaded to 'data_sets'

eg. 

data_sets = load('horse1')

To perform the statistical analysis, open train_stat, ensure that the train_'algorithm' file is set up how you want. In train_stat replace the current training algorithm with the one you wish to train.

All the probing data sets have been loaded into .mat files using the script preprocess_proben1. The mat files are included in the file.
